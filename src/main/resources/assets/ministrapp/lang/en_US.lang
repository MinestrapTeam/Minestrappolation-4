All types of Leaves, however, are very flammable and can be used as somewhat inefficient fuel.
minechiridion.sponge.desc=A dry Sponge block. When placed in Water, it will remove all the Water sources within a certain area and become Wet. The Water, however, is prone to re-filling in around the Sponge afterward, so it is easier to remove water located in a small, enclosed area.
minechiridion.wet_sponge.desc=A wet Sponge block. Doesn't absorb Water like a dry Sponge would, but it can be dried again by smelting it.
minechiridion.glass.desc=A block of raw glass. It was roughly hewn of raw Sand, so its surface isn't as clear as that of Polished Glass. Useful for decoration, as well as several recipes.
minechiridion.lapis_ore.desc=A stone block with traces of Lapis Lazuli embedded in it. It can be found semi-rarely in small veins deep underground. It drops 4-8 Lapis Lazuli when mined without Silk Touch, though this number can be increased by mining it with Fortune.

minechiridion.tnt.desc=A volatile package of Sulfur and Silicon. When powered by Redstone, right-clicked with a Flint and Steel, or fired from a Dispenser, it will start flashing for a few seconds. In this state, it will be affected by physics, and will proceed to violently explode soon after. TNT is commonly used for clearing away large areas of blocks - it is not, however, advisable for resource mining, as most of the drops are destroyed in the explosion.
minechiridion.bookshelf.desc=A decorative, wooden shelf full of books. When placed near an Enchanting Table, it will shoot particles toward the Table, boosting the maximum level of its available enchantments. Unfortunately, the Bookshelf's construction requires the books to be molecularly fused to the shelf, rendering them unreadable.
minechiridion.mossy_cobblestone.desc=A block of Cobblestone with Moss growing between the cracks. It must have been sitting in one spot for quite some time.
minechiridion.obsidian.desc=A block of shiny, black volcanic glass formed by rapidly cooled Lava. It seems to possess trans-dimensional properties, and is said to have been frequently used by the Farlanders before their dissapearance.
minechiridion.torch.desc=A flaming Stick. Useful for lighting up caves, as well as for decorative home lighting. It can be placed on the top or sides of any solid block, but breaks off if that block is broken. Strangely, it doesn't seem to be capable of igniting other blocks, despite being on fire itself.
minechiridion.fire.desc=Fire. Literally just fire. How did you even get this? Stop trying to break the game.
minechiridion.mob_spawner.desc=A mysterious cage made of some unknown material. The inside seems to be wreathed in flames, and it appears to summon monsters into the air around it. You have no idea how it works, let alone who made it.

You cannot, however, place more than 2 Chests next to eachother, making them less optimal than Crates or Barrels for compact mass storage.
minechiridion.redstone.desc=A strange, red, conductive type of dust. It can be placed on the ground to form a sort of binary electrical wiring that can power various machines and mechanisms. Redstone Dust can connect to adjacent Redstone Dust, adjacent Redstone mechanisms, or even adjacent Dust located one block above or below itself. Redstone current can travel through a maximum of 15 Redstone Dust blocks, and can also be transfered through solid, non-Redstone blocks in certain situations.
minechiridion.diamond_ore.desc=A stone block with Diamonds embedded in it. It can be found rarely in small veins very deep underground. It drops 1 Diamond when mined without Silk Touch, though this number can be increased by mining it with Fortune.

minechiridion.crafting_table.desc=One of the most useful blocks in the game, this wooden workbench can be used to craft an enormous variety of blocks and items. Its interface works the same as the in-inventory crafting menu, but with a 3x3 grid instead of a 2x2 - placing certain items in certain configurations on the grid will produce other items, which can be picked out of the slot to the right of the crafting grid.
minechiridion.furnace.desc=A small, stone oven used for smelting certain blocks and items into other blocks and items. To-be-smelted items go in the top left slot, and fuel items go in the bottom left slot. If the top left item can be smelted, the smelting process will start, and the fuel will begin to deplete - each fuel source lasts a different duration than others. Once the arrow in the center fills up completely, the smelting result can be picked out of the right slot. This block is also a necessary ingredient in several later game machines.
minechiridion.sign.desc=A small, wooden sign. When placed, you can type up to 4 lines of text on it. Signs are also impervious to liquids and have no collision, making them useful for controling Water flows - they can, however, be ignited by Lava.

minechiridion.rail.desc=A set of Iron tracks designed to guide a Minecart. Placing a Minecart on the tracks will attach it to the Rails, where it can be moved freely along the track. Adjacent Minecart Rails will attach to one another, and can even attach to rails one block above or below themselves. Normal Rails do now, however, move their Minecarts, which must be powered along by other means. Additionally, mobs will avoid walking over Rails when they can, making them useful for routing monsters to specific locations.
minechiridion.lever.desc=A simple Lever made of Wood and stone. Right-clicking it will cause it to produce a full Redstone signal, making it useful for turning Redstone devices on and off. Levers can be placed on any solid side of a block, and will break if the block they are connected to is broken.
minechiridion.stone_pressure_plate.desc=A thin stone tile that emits a full Redstone signal whenever a mob or player steps on it, making it useful for auto-opening doors, player traps, or mob alarms.
minechiridion.wood_pressure_plate.desc=A thin Wood tile that emits a full Redstone signal whenever any entity (including Items and projectiles) touches it.
minechiridion.redstone_ore.desc=A stone block with Redstone Dust embedded in it. It can be found somewhat often in medium-sized veins deep underground. It drops 4-5 Redstone Dust when mined without Silk Touch, though this number can be increased by mining it with Fortune.
minechiridion.redstone_torch.desc=A special Torch fueled by Redstone rather than Coal. It acts like a normal Torch, but emits far less light. It does, however, emit a full Redstone signal to any adjacent Redstone Dust or components, and stops emitting current when the block it is placed on is powered. This behavior makes it extremely useful for things like inverting Redstone current, building Redstone logic gates, and moving Redstone current vertically.
minechiridion.stone_button.desc=A small stone Button, which can be activated by right-clicking it. Once activated, it delivers a 10 tick Redstone Pulse, making it useful for machines which don't need to stay active.
minechiridion.wood_button.desc=A small wooden Button. It behaves in exactly the same way as a Stone Button, but can be forced to stay active by firing an Arrow into it.
minechiridion.snow_layer.desc=A thin layer of Snow, often found coating the ground in snowy biomes. Snow layers can be stacked up to 8 times, with a single layer being 2 pixels tall, and 8 layers being a full block. When broken, they drop nothing unless harvested with a Shovel, in which case they drop a number of Snowballs corresponding to the number of stacked layers. Snow Layers will melt over time when placed near a light source. Snowy weather will also create Snow Layers on the ground, though they will not stack any higher than one layer.
minechiridion.ice.desc=A block of frozen water. Ice can be found covering the rivers and lakes in snowy biomes, and drops nothing when broken unless harvested with Silk Touch. It is slippery, and is thus often useful for transporting items or entities long distances. Any Water sources will turn into Ice over time when placed in a snowy biome with exposure to the sun, making it easily obtainable and renewable. Like Snow Layers, Ice will melt into a Water source when placed near any light source.
minechiridion.snow.desc=A solid block of Snow. Mostly decorative, though its fast mining speed makes it useful as scaffolding. It drops nothing when broken, unless harvested with a Shovel, in which case it drops 4 Snowballs. Unlike Snow Layers, it does not melt when near light sources.
minechiridion.cactus.desc=A prickly, thorn-coated plant found in Desert biomes. While its short arms won't hurt the player, running into the base will, making it useful for protecting your yard from monsters. When broken, it can be re-planted on Sand, Red Sand, or other Cacti. A single Cactus block will grow to 3 block high over time, but they can be manually stacked as high as you want. It has few crafting uses, but can be smelted into Green Dye.
minechiridion.clay.desc=A block of thick, clumpy earth found commonly at the bottoms of Swamps and River beds. It drops 4 Clay Balls when harvested without Silk Touch, and the block itself can be smelted into Hardened Clay.
minechiridion.reeds.desc=A bundle of thin, bamboo-like stalks often found growing on the coasts of Rivers, lakes, and Oceans. Can be planted on any Sand, Dirt, Grass, or Podzol block that has a neighboring Water block to produce a Sugar Cane plant, which will grow up to 3 blocks tall before stopping.

minechiridion.oak_fence.desc=A decorative Fence made of Oak Planks. When placed, it can connect to adjacent Fences, as well as adjacent solid blocks. Despite appearing only 1 block tall, it actually has a collision of 1.5 blocks, preventing mobs and players from easily jumping over it.
minechiridion.birch_fence.desc=A decorative Fence made of Birch Planks. When placed, it can connect to adjacent Fences, as well as adjacent solid blocks. Despite appearing only 1 block tall, it actually has a collision of 1.5 blocks, preventing mobs and players from easily jumping over it.
minechiridion.spruce_fence.desc=A decorative Fence made of Spruce Planks. When placed, it can connect to adjacent Fences, as well as adjacent solid blocks. Despite appearing only 1 block tall, it actually has a collision of 1.5 blocks, preventing mobs and players from easily jumping over it.
minechiridion.jungle_fence.desc=A decorative Fence made of Jungle Planks. When placed, it can connect to adjacent Fences, as well as adjacent solid blocks. Despite appearing only 1 block tall, it actually has a collision of 1.5 blocks, preventing mobs and players from easily jumping over it.
minechiridion.acacia_fence.desc=A decorative Fence made of Acacia Planks. When placed, it can connect to adjacent Fences, as well as adjacent solid blocks. Despite appearing only 1 block tall, it actually has a collision of 1.5 blocks, preventing mobs and players from easily jumping over it.
minechiridion.dark_oak_fence.desc=A decorative Fence made of Dark Oak Planks. When placed, it can connect to adjacent Fences, as well as adjacent solid blocks. Despite appearing only 1 block tall, it actually has a collision of 1.5 blocks, preventing mobs and players from easily jumping over it.
minechiridion.nether_brick_fence.desc=A decorative Fence made of Nether Bricks. When placed, it can connect to adjacent Fences, as well as adjacent solid blocks. Despite appearing only 1 block tall, it actually has a collision of 1.5 blocks, preventing mobs and players from easily jumping over it.
minechiridion.pumpkin.desc=A cube-shaped Pumpkin with the vine still growing on one side. Though it does not seem to posess any unique qualities, it has been found that Pumpkins have some connection with Golemancy, and can be placed in certain configurations with other blocks to form different types of utility Golems. If you don't want to make it into food, you could always try carving it. Wearing a Pumpkin on your head is said to help avoid the wrath of Endermen, but then again, you wouldn't be able to see a thing...
minechiridion.netherrack.desc=A strange, somewhat mushy, red block of stone found just about everywhere in the Nether. The stench it emits is nearly unbearable, and it's unclear what gives it such a vivid color, but it is quite useful in its ability to sustain a flame indefinitely.
minechiridion.soul_sand.desc=A brown, sticky sand that slows entities walking through it. It could be a trick of the light, but the shadows on the surface look almost like faces, and it seems to be emitting an almost imperceptible screaming sound...
minechiridion.glowstone.desc=A glowing block of lumpy, luminescent pebbles that seem to be stuck together with a great deal of Glowmoss sap. It can be found growing in almost stalactite-like clusters dripping from the roof of the Nether. It emits a bright light level when placed, making it useful for both decorative and underwater lighting. It drops 2-4 Glowstone Dust when mined, unless harvested with Silk Touch.
minechiridion.lit_pumpkin.desc=A purple, luminescent Pumpkin, created by melting Purple Glowshroom essence into the skin of a Pumpkin. Like normal Pumpkins, Glowpumpkins can be used for various purposes in Golemancy, and are useful for decorative lighting as an alternative to Glowstone.
minechiridion.cake.desc=An attractive looking, white-frosted Cake. It cannot be eaten directly, but once placed, each slice eated by right-clicking will restore 1 bar of hunger and 0.4 saturation points, ammounting to 7 hunger bars and 7 saturation points total. Cakes are often regarded as a symbol of status, due to their high resource cost and relatively low hunger output.
minechiridion.redstone_repeater.desc=A small Redstone device designed to extend a Redstone current. A Repeater recieving any level of Redstone current will emit a full level 15 current in the direction it is facing, allowing it to effectively extend a signal farther than 15 blocks. Powering a Repeater from the side using another Repeater will lock the first Repeater in whichever power state it was in, no matter whether it is currently recieving power or not - a trick that becomes quite useful for logic gates and the like.

minechiridion.trapdoor.desc=A small, horizontally hinged, wooden door. It can be opened by right-clicking it or powering it with Redstone. Contrary to its name, Trapdoors are one of the least useful blocks for trapping players, as they are very easy to distinguish from any surrounding blocks. Unlike normal Doors, however, they do not break when the block they were placed on is broken, making them very useful for decoration.
minechiridion.monster_egg_stone.desc=A block of Stone containing a hidden Silverfish.
minechiridion.monster_egg_cobblestone.desc=A block of Cobblestone containing a hidden Silverfish.
minechiridion.monster_egg_stonebrick.desc=A block of Stone Bricks containing a hidden Silverfish.

minechiridion.red_mushroom_block.desc=A block from a Huge Red Mushroom. It sometimes drops a Red Mushroom when broken, unless harvested with Silk Touch. Though it doesn't have as many uses as normal Red Mushrooms, it can be used as fuel or melted into more efficient stew.
minechiridion.iron_bars.desc=Rusty, almost prison-style Iron Bars for all your rustic fence needs. They will connect to any adjacent Iron Bars or solid blocks, similarly to Fences or Glass Panes. These seem to be found often in cells in abandoned ruins - but what were they trapping inside?
minechiridion.glass_pane.desc=A thin pane of Glass, used most often in constructing windows. It will connect to adjacent Panes and solid blocks when placed, similarly to Fences.
minechiridion.melon_block.desc=An enormous, cubic Melon block. It bursts into slices when harvested without Silk Touch.
minechiridion.vine.desc=A hanging, tangled mat of Vines commonly seen in Swamps and Jungles. It grows and spreads along the sides of blocks, and can hang in open air provided there is another Vine block above it. The thick, knotted tendrils are so sturdy that they can be climbed in the same manner as a Ladder - but only when there is a block located behind them.
minechiridion.oak_fence_gate.desc=A short wooden gate made of Oak planks. Fences will connect to it, and it lowers slightly when connected to Cobbled Walls. Like Doors, it can be opened by right-clicking or powering it with Redstone, and like Fences, its collisions are 1.5 blocks tall, preventing mobs and players from jumping it.
minechiridion.birch_fence_gate.desc=A short wooden gate made of Birch planks. Fences will connect to it, and it lowers slightly when connected to Cobbled Walls. Like Doors, it can be opened by right-clicking or powering it with Redstone, and like Fences, its collisions are 1.5 blocks tall, preventing mobs and players from jumping it.
minechiridion.spruce_fence_gate.desc=A short wooden gate made of Spruce planks. Fences will connect to it, and it lowers slightly when connected to Cobbled Walls. Like Doors, it can be opened by right-clicking or powering it with Redstone, and like Fences, its collisions are 1.5 blocks tall, preventing mobs and players from jumping it.
minechiridion.jungle_fence_gate.desc=A short wooden gate made of Jungle planks. Fences will connect to it, and it lowers slightly when connected to Cobbled Walls. Like Doors, it can be opened by right-clicking or powering it with Redstone, and like Fences, its collisions are 1.5 blocks tall, preventing mobs and players from jumping it.
minechiridion.acacia_fence_gate.desc=A short wooden gate made of Acacia planks. Fences will connect to it, and it lowers slightly when connected to Cobbled Walls. Like Doors, it can be opened by right-clicking or powering it with Redstone, and like Fences, its collisions are 1.5 blocks tall, preventing mobs and players from jumping it.
minechiridion.dark_oak_fence_gate.desc=A short wooden gate made of Dark Oak planks. Fences will connect to it, and it lowers slightly when connected to Cobbled Walls. Like Doors, it can be opened by right-clicking or powering it with Redstone, and like Fences, its collisions are 1.5 blocks tall, preventing mobs and players from jumping it.
minechiridion.mycellium.desc=A block of Dirt coated in a purple, fungal crust, somewhat similar to Grass. Like Grass, it will spread to nearby Dirt blocks with a high enough light level over time, though it can sustain far less plant species than Grass. Unlike Grass, however, Mycellium can sustain Mushrooms at any light level and in direct sunlight, a property only shared by Podzol. Mycellium itself cannot be tilled, though the Dirt it drops when mined without Silk Touch can.
minechiridion.waterlilly.desc=A large, solid water plant found in Swamp biomes. It can only be planted on Water sources, but has an almost perfectly flat collision, making it popular as a cover for Water sources in farms. Though it cannot be grown or spread like most other plants, it can occasionally be found when fishing.
minechiridion.nether_brick.desc=A block of dark maroon bricks created by melting down Netherrack. Unlike the block it was made from, however, these Bricks are quite structurally durable.
minechiridion.enchanting_table.desc=A magical utility block designed for casting enchantments on tools, weapons, and armor. The GUI contains two slots and three empty bars to the right of them. When an enchantable tool, weapon, or piece of armor is placed in the left slot, and some Lapis Lazuli is placed in the right, the three slots on the right will light up, displaying the enchantment possibilities. The XP Orb with the number to the left of each of these bars indicates how many levels will be spent on the enchantment, while the number on the bottom right of the bar indicates the level the player must be to select it. Mousing over the enchantment options also shows the first of however many enchantments the option contains, though the enchants themselves are randomly selected. Additionally, each numbered option requires the corresponding ammount of Lapis Lazuli to fuel the table - choosing option 1 will consume 1 Lapis from the right slot, while option 3 will consume 3. Upon choosing an enchantment, the item in the left slot will be enchanted, and the Lapis Lazuli will be consumed.
minechiridion.brewing_stand.desc=A device used for the brewing and bottling of Potions. It must be fueled with Blaze Powder by placing it in the top left slot before it can be used. Once the orange fuel meter has been filled, up to 3 Potions or Water Bottles can be placed in the three slots at the bottom. Once the Bottles are placed and a compatible ingredient has been placed in the top center slot, the Potions will begin brewing, consuming some of the fuel meter and transforming into their resulting forms after a few seconds.
minechiridion.cauldron.desc=An Iron kettle designed for storing Water. It can be filled either by activating it with a Bucket of Water, or by leaving it out in the rain, and once filled, can be used to fill empty Buckets and Glass Bottles. Cauldrons are particularly useful for storing Water in the Nether, and can also be used to wash the Dye off of Leather Armor, or to remove the topmost layer of a Banner design. Jumping into a filled Cauldron will extinguish fire, and filled Cauldrons will additionally output a Comparator signal relative to their current fill-level.
minechiridion.end_portal_frame.desc=A mysterious mechanism used for creating a gateway to another dimension. It seems it must be filled with something in order to function...
minechiridion.end_stone.desc=A block of porous, white stone found abundantly in the End. Though it doesn't seem to have any significant magical properties, it is the only block that can sustain Chorus plants, and seems to be hospitable to Glow Moss as well.
minechiridion.dragon_egg.desc=An enormous black egg left by a slain Ender Dragon. It seems to be the only one of its kind. Faint scratching sounds keep coming from the inside, but perhaps it would be best to avoid hatching it...
minechiridion.redstone_lamp.desc=A Redstone mechanism that emits a bright light when powered.
minechiridion.emerald_ore.desc=A stone block with Emeralds embedded in it. It can be found very rarely in tiny veins underground in Extreme Hills biomes. It drops 1 Emerald when mined without Silk Touch, though this number can be increased by mining it with Fortune.
minechiridion.ender_chest.desc=An enchanted Chest made of Obsidion. Using Farlandian dimensional rift technology, anyone who opens the Chest is able to access their own personal pocket dimension, in which they can store up to 27 stacks of items. While it is impossible to access anyone else's pocket dimensions, one may access their own from any Ender Chest at any location, allowing it to act as a highly portable and secure storage vault. Unfortunately, the Chest itself is somewhat unstable, and will break into 8 Obsidian when broken without Silk Touch.
minechiridion.tripwire_hook.desc=A metal hook on a wood base, used for building lines of Tripwire. When placed opposite another Tripwire Hook and connected to said Hook with String, the two Hooks will emit a Redstone signal any time an entity touches any part of the connecting String. Additionally, the Hooks will also emit a Redstone pulse if any part of the String is broken without Shears, preventing players from easily defusing Tripwire traps.
minechiridion.emerald_block.desc=A solid block of Emeralds. Mostly useful for decoration, compressed storage, and displaying your gratuitous wealth, but can also be used in a Beacon Base.
minechiridion.beacon.desc=A powerful magical artifact that can grant unending status effects to any players within its radius.
